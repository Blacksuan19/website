      Image Style transfer is a neural network algorithm that copies the style
      of an existing image into another image while preserving the image’s
      content, there have been multiple algorithms to perform style transfer one
      of which is using style attentional networks. attention is a modern
      algorithm that helps neural networks distinguish important parts of speech
      or an image, in this instance we use attention to identify the important
      parts of image features to properly apply an overall style rather than
      just a mask and to conserve parts of the content that are deemed
      important.

    <h3>Workflow</h3>
    <p>
      the general workflow of the application is the API will receive the
      content and style images, run them through the model and return the
      resulting image as base64 encoded.

    <h3>Components</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#model">Model</a></li>
      <li><a href="#api">API</a></li>
      <li><a href="#app">Cross Platform Application</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="model">Model</h3>
    <p>
      The model uses a modified version of
      <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02342">style attentional networks</a>,
      with the main changes being the identity loss coefficients, the
      architecture consists of 3 separate models, an encoder, a style network
      and a decoder, the encoder used here is VGG-16.

    <h3 id="api">API</h3>
    <p>
      The API is implemented using flask and flasgger for openAPI
      documentations, FloydHub is used to deploy the API in the cloud for
      general availability.

    <ul>
      <li>Allow changing style-content tradeoff during inference</li>
      <li>
        Accept style images as a base64 encoded image or a path to a style in
        the project S3 bucket
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="app">Cross Platform Application</h3>
    <p>The application is build using flutter with support for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Android</li>
      <li>IOS</li>
      <li>Windows</li>
      <li>Web</li>
