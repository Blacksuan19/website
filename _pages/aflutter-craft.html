            Image Style transfer is a neural network algorithm that copies the style
                  of an existing image into another image while preserving the imageâ€™s
                  content, there have been multiple algorithms to perform style transfer one
                  of which is using style attentional networks. attention is a modern
                  algorithm that helps neural networks distinguish important parts of speech
                  or an image, in this instance we use attention to identify the important
                  parts of image features to properly apply an overall style rather than
                  just a mask and to conserve parts of the content that are deemed
                  important.

        <h3>Workflow</h3>
        <p>
            the general workflow of the application is the API will receive the
                  content and style images, run them through the model and return the
                  resulting image as base64 encoded.

        </ul>
        <h3 id="model">Model</h3>
        <p>
            The model uses a modified version of
            <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02342">style attentional networks</a>,
                      with the main changes being the identity loss coefficients, the
                      architecture consists of 3 separate models, an encoder, a style network
                      and a decoder, the encoder used here is VGG-16.

        <h3 id="api">API</h3>
        <p>
            The API is implemented using flask and flasgger for openAPI
                  documentations, FloydHub is used to deploy the API in the cloud for
                  general availability.

            <li>
                Accept style images as a base64 encoded image or a path to a style in
                        the project S3 bucket

        <h3 id="app">Cross Platform Application</h3>
        <p>The application is build using flutter with support for:</p>
        <ul>
