## Deployment

The contract is already deployed to the ropstan test network using
[infura](http://infura.io/), to redeploy you need to use the first account from
the accounts generated by the seed phrase in truffle-config.json.<br><br> more
information on how to deploy and interact with contracts on infura in this
[guide](https://blog.infura.io/deploying-smart-contracts-managing-transactions-ethereum/).<br>

- Deployed contract address:
  [ropstan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x8f129e60fd0a99128b234ab2ad434178df78442d).
- Run `truffle migrate --network ropstan` to deploy to ropstan test network

## Web Interface development

There are 2 user interfaces, one for the customer and another for the
admin/regulator, which one is loaded depends on the account selected in
metamask, if its the first account in ganache then its the admin, o add accounts
from ganache to metamask follow
[this guide](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/truffle-with-metamask).

- Start the server using `npm run dev`

## Some Notes

- Refresh the page after changing account in metamask.
- `tailwind.config.js` enables tailwind IntelliSense in vscode with the
  [tailwind extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).
